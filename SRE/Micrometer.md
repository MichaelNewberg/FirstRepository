# Micrometer
Micrometer  is similar to slf4j: by itself it does nothing. When used with a tool like SpringBoot however, it provides the means for exposing relevant application metrics that we can then measure using a tool of our choice.
    -Micrometer works as a "simple facade"
    -Micrometer allows us to expose common metrics provided by Spring that we will use to measure our SLI's
